# ABOUT JAVA
# What is JAVA?
- **Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.**
- Java was developed by **Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle)** in the year 1995. 
- **James Gosling** is known as the father of Java.
- **Before Java, its name was Oak.** Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the Oak name to Java.

# Plateforms
- **Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.**

# Application
According to Sun, **3 billion devices run Java.**
There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:

- **Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.**
- **Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.**
- **Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.**
- **Mobile**
- **Embedded System**
- **Smart Card**
- **Robotics**
- **Games, etc.**

# History of JAVA
- **The history of Java starts with the Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was suited for internet programming. Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.**

- **The principles for creating Java programming were "Simple, Robust, Portable, Platform-independent, Secured, High Performance, Multithreaded, Architecture Neutral, Object-Oriented, Interpreted, and Dynamic".**

# Why Java Programming named "Java"?
**Java is an island of Indonesia where the first coffee was produced (called java coffee). It is a kind of espresso bean. Java name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office.**
